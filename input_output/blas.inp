V       !N - only eigennumbers, V - also vectors
A       !A - all, V - interval for eigenvalues, I - numbers for them
U       !U - upper or L - lower triangle of A is stored
0.d0    !Lower value of the interval for the eigenvectors
1.d0    !Upper value of the interval for the eigenvectors
10      !Number of negative-energy states (if Line #2 = 'I')
10      !Number of positive-energy states (if Line #2 = 'I')
1.d-16  !Precision tolerance
